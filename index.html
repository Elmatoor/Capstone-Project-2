            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p class="text">
              Hi my name is Robin Andersson!<br />
              I have always had a great interest in data and technology, so when
              I decided to study I choosed Agile Java methods. During my
              studies, I have been leading the group together with a classmate
              to develop a sinking ship game in JavaFX. What interested me the
              most was the graphic work involved in making the game not only
              look good, but also give the game an intuitive design.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              Frontend has interested me very much during my studies, which has
              led me to design and developed a website for a board game
              association called Den Stora Nyckelpigan. In group work, I like to
              take a leading role by structuring the work through project
              planning in GitHub and followed up on the group's work. My
              interest in programming has also led me to learn Unity in my spare
              time with a friend by developing a game for mobiles. I find it
              easy to learn and would rather see solutions than problems.
